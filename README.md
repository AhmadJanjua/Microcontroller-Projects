# Microcontroller-Projects
A set of microcontroller group projects coded using MPLAB to work with Microchip Microcontroller.

# App 1:
App 1 is a stopwatch app for the terminal. It uses the internal circuit of the microcontroller and uses a the nominal 32kHz clock speed to calculate elapsed time.
Features included in this app are:
  1. Start timer
  2. Stop timer
  3. Reset Timer
  4. Get notification of countdown completion.
  
# App 2
App 2 is an Etch a Sketch made using a microcontroller and python to display the sketch.
Features it includes are: 
  1. Drawing
  2. Clearing screen
  3. Changing the rate of drawing
  4. Changing the axis of drawing
  5. Resetting system through WDT
This app used ADC, interrupts, UART, timing and more to make a full application from the hardware to software.

# Projects
The projects were simple drivers that were created to make the full applications. They are focused more on specific functionality. Project 2 deals with button interrupts.
There are projects for all the functionality used in App 1 and 2.
